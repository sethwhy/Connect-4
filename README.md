# Connect 4

## Intended Project

The 5 of us have settled on making a game commonly known as connect four. We plan to implement a lot of different aspects and an AI that could potentially play against the user. There will be many customization settings and to achieve this we have split into mini groups, in which every can contribute to the final product.

## Connect 4 should include

- Start menu
- Color customization
- AI and Local play
- Commented code/Instructions
- Game rules
